1. ITALY

Italy is very diverse and there are many beautiful cities. It has awesome architecture, culture and history. Food is delicious.

These are the top 3 cities according to me in Italy.

Venice

Venice is one of a kind, such a colorful and romantic city.
2. GEORGIA

Georgia is home to Caucasus Mountain villages and Black Sea beaches. It is a beautiful country and has a Eastern European vibe. It’s also very cheap country for long term travel.
3. Poland

4. Warsaw

This city was almost destroyed in WW2. It came back strong and developed. 
A very beautiful and affordable city for tourists, comparatively less touristy then other capital cities in Europe.
15. MEXICO: Look out Spain and Italy, Mexico's culinary scene has entered the ring. The country logged three restaurants — Pujol, Quintonil, and Biko — on the 2015 World's 50 Best Restaurants List. All three are in Mexico City.
